class Tv {
    constructor(brand, channel, volume) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.channel = 1;
        this.volume = 50;
  }
}

//1) Create a TV class with properties like brand, channel and volume.
//    Specify brand in a constructor parameter. Channel should be 1 by default. Volume should be 50 by default.
//2) Add methods to increase and decrease volume. Volume can't never be below 0 or above 100.
//3) Add a method to set the channel. Let's say the TV has only 50 channels so if you try to set channel 60 the TV will stay at the current channel.
//4) Add a method to reset TV so it goes back to channel 1 and volume 50. (Hint: consider using it from the constructor).
//5) It's useful to write a status, that returns info about the TV status like: "Panasonic at channel 8, volume 75".
